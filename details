A dashboard is a collection of several views, letting you compare a variety of data simultaneously. For example, if you have a set of views that you review every day, you can create a dashboard that displays all the views at once, rather than navigate to separate worksheets.

Like worksheets, you access dashboards from tabs at the bottom of a workbook. Data in sheets and dashboards is connected; when you modify a sheet, any dashboards containing it change, and vice versa. Both sheets and dashboards update with the latest available data from the data source.
